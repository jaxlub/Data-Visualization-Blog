    "title": "Effects of Annual Rainfall on Malaria",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Malaria is a pathogon carried by mosquitoes and has killed millions of humans over the course of human history. Using a Malaria Dataset from Tidy Tuesday I will investigate global trends in Malaria occurrences and location through the last 20 years. In addition I will use a Rainfall dataset to see if there is a relationship between annual rainfall and Malaria cases. Mosquitoes are highly dependent on water in their early stages of life and is critical for development so rainfall could be a major predictor in Malaria cases. Using these data sets I will explore how annual rainfall and Malaria cases are related.\n\nData Tidying and Exploration\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(modelr)\n\n# Grabbing data\nmalaria_untidy <- readr::read_csv('/Users/jaxlub/Documents/GitHub/DATA334Spring24-DataVisualization/data/malaria_inc.csv')\nmalaria_df <- malaria_untidy |> rename(Cases = `Incidence of malaria (per 1,000 population at risk) (per 1,000 population at risk)`)\n\n\nurl <- \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_annual_precipitation\"\n\nh <- read_html(url)\n\ntab <- h |> html_nodes(\"table\")\n\nrainfall_untidy <- tab[[1]] |> html_table()\n \nrainfall_df <- rainfall_untidy |> select(Country, `mm/year)`, Continent) |> rename(\"MMannual\" = `mm/year)`)\n\nfull_df <- left_join(malaria_df, rainfall_df, by = join_by(\"Entity\" == \"Country\"))\n\nfull_df <- full_df |> mutate(MMannual = if_else(is.na(MMannual),\n                               true = \"0\", false = MMannual)) \n\nfull_df$MMannual<- as.numeric(full_df$MMannual)\n\nmalaria_trend <- full_df |> \n  group_by(Year) |> \n  summarise(avg = mean(Cases), total = n(), stdev = sd(Cases)) |>\n  mutate(se = stdev / sqrt(total), \n         lb_se = avg - se,\n         ub_se = avg + se)\n\nggplot(data = malaria_trend, aes(x = as.factor(Year), y = avg)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes( ymin = lb_se, ymax = ub_se), width = .5, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Worldwide Cases\",\n       title = \"Global Malaria Trends\",\n       subtitle = \"with Standard Deviation of Country Averages\")\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see since 2000 global Malaria cases has been on the decline.\n\navg <- full_df |> group_by(Entity) |> summarise(avg_malaria = mean(Cases), avg_rain = mean(MMannual)) |> filter(avg_rain != 0)\nworld_df <- ggplot2::map_data(\"world\")\n\nfull <- left_join(world_df, avg, by = join_by(\"region\" == \"Entity\"))\n\nggplot(data = full, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", aes(fill = avg_malaria)) +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of Malaria cases are found in Africa through the Middle East and China with a handful of cases in Central and South America.\n\nmalaria.lm <- lm(avg_malaria ~ avg_rain, data = avg)\ngrid <- full_df |> data_grid(Cases = seq_range(Cases, n = 6)) \naug_df <- augment(malaria.lm, newdata = avg,\n                   interval = \"confidence\")\n\n## summary(malaria.lm) for the adj r-sqred\n\nggplot(data = avg, aes(x = avg_rain, y = avg_malaria)) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = aug_df, aes(y = .fitted, ymin = .lower, ymax = .upper), alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_line(data = aug_df, aes(x = avg_rain, y = .fitted), colour = \"blue\", linewidth = 1.2)+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Average Annual Rainfall\", \n       y = \"Average Annual Malaria Cases\",\n       title = \"Impact of Rainfall on Malaria Cases\")\n\n\n\n\nThrough this visual we can see that there is a positive relationship between Annual Rainfall and Malaria Cases. As rainfall increases so too does Malaria cases. The individual points are also plotted in the background to show distribution of and number of cases in sample.\n\n\nFlaws\nThis data set is not as comprehensive as I would have liked and does not have many data points for many other regions of the world. Because of this trying to build a model using incomplete data does not lead to very strong models. This model has an adjusted R squared value of 5.7% which is decent but not extremely strong. Furthermore I wish the rainfall data set had more data by year and not just an average for each Country. With data by year it would be much more beneficial for determining trends between rain and total cases. These three visuals are all strong communicators of important data. In the first visual, distribution can be seen via error bars and averages can also be seen. In the world visual the location of all Malaria hot spots is easily apparent. In the last visual our model is clear in relation to our actual data showing both our model, the number of samples we used, and their distribution."

    "title": "MMR Vaccination Rates in Schools Around the US",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In light of the COVID pandemic, vaccinations have been in the front of peoples minds. Vaccines cover much more then COVID and have been implemented at state and federal levels across the country. Many schools require vaccines to prevent the spread of disease. A common vaccine for children is MMR - a vaccine for Mumps, Measles and Rubella. In this data set we will explore vaccination rates and trends throughout 46,412 schools in 32 states. This of course begs the question where are students most vaccinated and where are students least vaccinated? To look into this we will look at geographic location and type of school.\nData: Tidy Tuesday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this visual we can see states with MMR vaccine rates over 95% in yellow and 90-95% in green. Washington (blue) and Arkansas (purple) can be seen with even lower rates. The distribution of vaccine rates varies across the United States and does not appear to have any larger trends. This visual allows all states and there vaccination rates to be seen with ease. Within each state there are a variety of different types of schools ranging from public to private and this could also impact vaccination rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this visual we can see how vaccination rates of MMR differ throughout school types. The standard error of the means is depicted in the black bars with no overlap between groups. The non-public schools have a remarkably low vaccination rate compared to any other group followed by private then charter schools. The number of schools in each sample group can be seen in the white box on each column. We can also see at BOCES, kindergarten and public schools almost all kids have received their MMR vaccines.\nUsing this data set we can see trends on how vaccination rates differ by state and school type. That being said many states are missing from this dataset and many schools have many null values. I eliminated null values for the first map in the mmr avg and in doing so inadvertently eliminated 11 states completly (of 32) that only had null data for mmr vaccines. Moving forward I would love to look at vaccination datat from the rest of the states. I would be curioes to also explore vaccination rates in the years leading up to the pandemic vs after the pandemic. Are people more likely to get vaccinated after a global pandemic?\n\nConnections to Class\nMy first visuals uses concepts we learned in building maps. In addition this visual uses a unordered color scale with bins to show how states land in their vaccination rates. This map does not show sample size, distribution or actual averages. In the second graph we have normal bar chart of each schools mean but I added error bars to show variation within each class, and counts to show the total within each class. In doing so I converted a visual that does not depict much information to one that conveys a lot more. It might have been better to use a box plot to show the distributions even more (as well as outliars) but I wanted to implement error bars we used in class."

    "title": "Using Points and Texture to predict Malignant Tumors",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Cancer impacts the lives of millions of people around the world. Effective identification of cancerous malignant tumors is critical for quick treatment response to improve outcomes. Non-cancerous benign tumors do not pose the same threats that malignant tumors do. With this in mind we will look at how points (a tumor scoring system) and tumor texture can be used to identify tumor types. Taking this one step further we are going to investigate how a model could classify different points and visualize this in a clear and concise way.\nThis data set comes from Lisa Torrey’s Machine Learning Class.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndata <- read.csv(\"https://myslu.stlawu.edu/~ltorrey/ml/Cancer.csv\")\n\nggplot(data = data, aes(x = diagnosis, y = texture)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"pink\") + \n  labs(title = \"Distirbution of Texture in Benign and Malignant Tumors\",\n      subtitle = \"212 Malignant tumors and 357 Benign tumors in dataset\",\n       x = \"Diagnosis\",\n       y = \"Texture\")\n\n\n\nggplot(data = data, aes(x = diagnosis, y = points)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"pink\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distirbution of Point Scores in Benign and Malignant Tumors\",\n       subtitle = \"212 Malignant tumors and 357 Benign tumors in dataset\",\n     x = \"Diagnosis\",\n     y = \"Score\")\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see through these visuals it appears that malignant tumors have increased texture and higher point scores then benign tumors. This indicates that these could be good instances to use in tumor prediction. For example a tumor with a higher score and increased texture has attributes similar to malignant tumors then one that has minimal texture and a score below 10 and thus we might be able to use this to classify future tumors. Now when building a model such as this it is much easier to see how models predict as opposed to ranges of numbers. To do this we will use a parttree showing areas where tumors are likely to be malignant vs benign.\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nremotes::install_github(\"grantmcdermott/parttree\")\nlibrary(parttree)\nset.seed(123) ## For consistent jitter\n\ndata$diagnosis = as.factor(data$diagnosis)\n\n## Build our tree using parsnip (but with rpart as the model engine)\ntree =\n  decision_tree() |>\n  set_engine(\"rpart\") |>\n  set_mode(\"classification\") |>\n  fit(diagnosis ~ texture + points, data = data)\n\n\n## Plot the data and model partitions\ndata |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = texture, y = points)) +\n  geom_jitter(aes(colour = diagnosis), alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_parttree(data = tree, aes(fill = diagnosis), alpha = 0.1) +\n  labs(x = \"Texture\",\n       y = \"Point Score\",\n       title = \"Classification Areas of Tumors\",\n       subtitle = \"Malignent and Benign Training Cases shown as Points\")\n\n\n\n\nFrom this visual we can see that using point score and texture classifies malignant tumors at higher ranges for both predictors. In addition we can see that there is a small range around a point score of 30 and texture of 500-600 that is often cancerous. This might be due to our training data set but could be investigated more with a larger data set. This visual allows us to see the boundaries of where this model would predict malignant or benign. Furthermore we can see how the model generalizes trends in the training data to a larger area for future points. Many other variables could be used in a classifying model but expanding beyond 2 predictors makes visualization much more difficult. I would like to see if there are more unexpected or stronger 2-predictor pairs for tumor identification within this dataset.\nWhile using a model such as this is not a fail-proof method for identifying cancerous tumors, it does pose a way to flag tumors that have increased chance of being cancerous in a cheaper and faster way to identify tumors that need immediate attention. While medical work often requires expensive procedures using a model that can rely on scan data such as texture and score can help mitigate the cost and increase treatment response time. The preliminary data could identify cancerous tumors before biopsy, histological or genetic analysis can be done. Furthermore this model represents a less invasive alternative (though should not replace further tests) to classify tumor types. Ideally this model would be used to speed up treatment and further medical procedures on malignant-predicted tumors and should never be used as the only identification for benign tumors as a false-positive has much fewer implications on human lives then false-negatives.\n\nConnection to Class\nMy first two visuals are basic box plots. I chose box plots because while they do not allow the viewer to see how many data points are present I added this manually. In doing so the user can see counts, distributions, spread, out liars and average within each class. In my next visual I used one of the exercises we have in our notes but did not review in class. Using this visual is a much simpler and effective way to convey both a model and distribution of our own data. I could have built the classifying model and print the coefficients and statistics but this is hardly interpretable. By doing a parttree we can see the decision boundaries that separate areas where a model would classify a point to benign or cancerous. This visual also helps show the relationship between our model and our training data with both the points and parttree colored in the same way further clarifying how class distribution impacted our model."
